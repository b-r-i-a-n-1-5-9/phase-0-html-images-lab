  <!--when it comes to the image element, there are some important things we need to remember -->
  <!-- first, the image element does not have a closing tag. This means that it is writen this way <img/> -->
  <!-- Some of the most common tags that we find within the image element are src which stands for source, alt which stands for alternative text. alt loads a text that provides a simple description of what the image would look like incase the image fails to load-->
  <!-- alt also helps the different abled individuals to gain a better browsing experience by reading out the text-->
  <!-- there is also the title attribute which will denote the title of the image if you want to include one. The title will show when one hovers over the image-->
